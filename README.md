# QIY

PROJECT OVERVIEW
The objective of this project is to develop a recreation of the 1981 puzzle video game, Qix with as much functionality as possible. Qix involves three main components: the marker, the Qix and the sparx. Using the arrow keys the user takes control of the marker. The objective is for the marker to take over as much of the board without hitting the Qix (which moves in random order) or the Sparx (Which moves along the edges of the collected land). We decided to use Pygame, as it was simple to learn and our team was familiar with the python programming language. We also used OOP to structure the code in a clean and organized manner.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE GAME
*-> Download main.exe
*-> Click on the file, and the game will start 
*-> If it says its a virus just ignore that ahaha :)
*-> Enjoy :D

GAME INSTRUCTIONS
*-> Press any key to start
*-> Use arrows keys to move around
*-> Claim as much percentage of the land to beat the level 
*-> Be careful not hit the Sparx or Qix (pssst you lose a life if you do)
*-> There are 10 levels in total with increasing difficulty
*-> Good luck!
