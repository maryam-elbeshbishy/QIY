# QIY
Qix Game 
The objective of this project is to develop a recreation of the 1981 puzzle video game, Qix with as much functionality as possible. Qix involves three main components: the marker, the Qix and the sparx. Using the arrow keys the user takes control of the marker. The objective is for the marker to take over as much of the board without hitting the Qix (which moves in random order) or the Sparx (Which moves along the edges of the collected land). We decided to use Pygame, as it was simple to learn and our team was familiar with the python programming language. We also used OOP to structure the code in a clean and organized manner.

Use arrows keys to move around.
